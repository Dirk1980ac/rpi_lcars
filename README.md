# Raspberry Pi LCARS Interface
This project is an attempt to create a functional [LCARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS) interface for the [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org/) using [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org). It's based heavily on the pioneering work of [Toby Kurien](https://tobykurien.com/).

# Changes/Additions
- Functional navigation buttons on side panel
- Functional (but not secure!) authentication screen

# Branches
The master branch of this repository is the code running on my personal hardware setup. It may or may not be useful for others as-is. The secondary "core" branch is intended to be suitable for upstream merges or for other users who wish to customize their own version.

Changes made in "core" will, whenever possible, retain backwards compatibility with the original code.
